# mthfr-fld-capstone

This Repository contains my IVSP Capstone project that investigates the relationship between MTHFR C677T mutation, Fatty Liver Disease,through analysis of their shared associated biomarkers. 

Final Deliverable: Quarto-rendered HTML document including:

  1) a PRISMA-informed mini meta-analysis on mechanisms and biomarker trends related to the C677T MTHFR mutation
  2) a population level NHANES analysis using SQL, Python, and R
  3) Integrated interpretation, visualization, and discussion

Note to self: additional README.md files created for project subdirectories since empty directory creation cannot be committed in Github.
