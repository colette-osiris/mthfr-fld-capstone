## Introduction 

## Project Aims/Research Questions 

## Project Rationale/structure 

## Why a split design? 


## PART 1: Mini Meta-Analysis 

### Background 

### Methods (PRISMA) 

#### Screening and selection process
- established documents: 
    * prisma-screening-tracker.csv	
    * prisma-search-log.md
#### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria (Preliminary) 

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- peer-reviewed material 
- published >= 2000 
- stratify MTHFR C677T variants (CC, CT, and TT) separately 
- measure 1+ of the relevant biomarkers:
  * Methionine, Homocysteine, Choline, Folate, Betaine, SAM/SAH, or Dimethylglycine
- measure biomarker(s) biologically (not via dietary intake) and quantitatively
- comparable assay methodology 

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- intervention studies where patient comorbidities are expected to impact one-carbon metabolism 
- studies that meet inclusion criteria but only report post-treatment metrics 
- no genotype stratification 
- self reported biomarkers 
- outcomes irrelevant to one-carbon metabolism or liver biolfy
