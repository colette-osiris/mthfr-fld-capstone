## Introduction 

## Project Aims/Research Questions 

## Project Rationale/structure 

## Why a split design? 


## PART 1: Mini Meta-Analysis 

### Background 

### Methods (PRISMA) 

#### Search strategy:
- Databases searched:
- Date range covered:
- Search terms / query logic:
- Filters/limits (language, humans, etc.):
- Last search date:
- How results were deduplicated:


#### Screening Workflow:

Screening procedure following a two-stage process: a title/abstract screening, then followed by a full-text review.
Records were tracked in 'prisma-screening-tracker.csv', and search decisions were logged in 'prisma-search-log.md', 
both of which can be found in the 'references/part1' folder of this project. 


- established documents: 
    * prisma-screening-tracker.csv	
    * prisma-search-log.md


#### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria (Preliminary) 

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- peer-reviewed material 
- published >= 2000 
- stratify MTHFR C677T variants (CC, CT, and TT) separately 
- measure 1+ of the relevant biomarkers:
  * Methionine, Homocysteine, Choline, Folate, Betaine, SAM/SAH, or Dimethylglycine
- measure biomarker(s) biologically (not via dietary intake) and quantitatively and extractable form.
   * extractable forms include: mean±SD, median+spread, effect estimate, or figure extractable. 
- comparable assay methodology 
- if intervention study: include baseline/control genotype-stratified biomarker data only. Exclude post-intervention biomarker outcomes.

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- intervention studies where patient comorbidities are expected to impact one-carbon metabolism 
- studies that meet inclusion criteria but only report post-treatment metrics 
- no genotype stratification 
- self reported biomarker intake or other proxy measures  
- outcomes irrelevant to one-carbon metabolism or liver biology

Additional Criteria Notes: 

Homozygote-only studies (CC vs TT without CT) may be retained for supporting evidence for directional trends, but will not be used for gradient CT inference. 

Studies using human or well-characterized translational model systems (e.g., Mthfr677C>T murine models) may be eligible if they reported genotype-stratified quantitative measurements of relevant one-carbon biomarkers.


#### Flow diagram

A PRISMA-styled flow diagram will be added after full-text source screenings are finalized.
